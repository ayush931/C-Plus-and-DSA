/**
 * A graph is a collection of nodes where each node might or might be point to other nodes.
 * Two nodes represent real life entities and are connected by edges representing relationship between the nodes / entities.

 * Types of Graphs -> undirected and directed
 * Edge Weights -> Weighted graph and Unweighted graph
 */

/**
 * Multigraph:- an undirected graph in which multiple edges are allowed between 2 nodes.
 * Simple graph:- an undirected graph in which both multiple edges and loops are not allowed.
 * Complete graph:- a complete graph is the one in which every node is directly connected to every other node.
 * Connected graph:- In this graph we have a direct or indirect path for every possible pair of vertices.
 * Path:- Path is a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a sequence.
 * Cycle:- a cycle cn is also a graph whose vertices can be arranged in cyclic sequence.
 * Degree:- Degree of a vertex in a graph is the total number of edges incident to it or away from it.
 * Indegree or Outdegree in directed
 * In directed graph, outdegree of a vertex is the total number of outgoing edges & indegree is total number of incoming edges.
 * Trees:- It is a connected graph with no cycles. If we remove all cycles from a graph we get a tree. If we remove an edge from a tree, it no more remains connected and should be called forest.
 * If there is a disconnected graph then the set of vertices which are connected forms a connected component.
 */

/**
 * Facts:- 
 * Tree |e| = |v| - 1
 * Forest |e| = |v| - 1 (max)
 * Connected |e| = |v| - 1 (min)
 * Undirected completed:- |E| = |v|C2  (max)
 * Directed completed: |E| = |v| x (|V| - 1)  (max)
