/**
 * Tree data structure:-
 * Non-linear data structures stores hierarchical data.
 * Elements are stored at different levels.
 * Elements are called nodes - which are connected/linked together to represent hierarchy
 */

/**
 * Terminology:- 
 * Root, Child Node, Parent Node, Sibling Node, Leaf, Number of edges, level, height, size, subtree

/**
 * Types of Trees:-
 * 1. Generic tree:- A node can have any number of child nodes.
 * 2. Binary Trees:- Tree in which a node can have maximum 2 child nodes.
 * 3. Binary search tree:- Binary tree in which all nodes in left subtree will have volume less than root node value and all nodes in right subtree will have value more than root node volume
 * 4. AVL trees:- Self balancing trees
 * Difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree can be 1, 0, -1

 * Binary Tree:-
 * Every node can have maximum 2 child nodes.
 * Every node will contain:- data, link to left child, link to right child
 * If any child does not exists, pointer will point to NULL
