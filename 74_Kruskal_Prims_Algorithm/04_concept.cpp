/**
 * Prism (MST): Special SubTree
 * Given a graph which consists of several edges connecting its nodes, find a subgraph of the given graph with the following properties:
 * The subgaph contains all the nodes present in the original graph.
 * The subgraph is minimum overall weight (sum of all edges) among all the subgraph.
 * It is also required that there is exactly one, exclusive path between any two nodes of the subgraph.
 * One specific node S is fixed as the starting point of the subgraph using Prim's Algorithm.
 * Find the total weight or the sum of all the edges in the subgraph.
 
 * Example:
 * n = 3
 * edge = [[1, 2, 2], [2, 3, 2], [1, 3, 3]]
 * start = 1
 */

/**
 * Prim's Algorithm:- In prims we start with a source node and then try to discover other nodes.
 * At the start of the algo, the discovery weight of every node except source is infinity, because we did not discovered anything
 */

/**
 * DS - visited set, priority_queue<pair>, unordered_map
 * insert the pair of <1,src> in the pq.
 * one by one remove the root element of the pq.
 * if the root element is already visited, then we will just continue
 * we mark the root visited
 * we store the weight of the pair in the ans
 * update the mapping
 * go to every neighbour of the current element, and only add those which are non visited and have a better weight proposition.
